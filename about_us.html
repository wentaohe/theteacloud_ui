<p>The long history of Jingdezhen ceramics has been very influential in both ancient and modern times. The large number of Jingdezhen ceramic relics excavated in China and around the world, as well as the auctions of Jingdezhen porcelain products in the collecting world, testify to the great historical value of Jingdezhen porcelain.</p>
